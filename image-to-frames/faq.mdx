## Using Image to Frames

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How do I install Image to Frames in Canva?">
1. Open Canva and click "Apps" in the left sidebar
2. Search for "Image to Frames"
3. Click "Add" or "Use" to install the app
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I convert an image to a frame?">
There are three ways:
1. **Tap an image in your Canva design** (recommended - fastest method)
2. **Upload an image file** (PNG, JPG, or SVG)
3. **Import a frame from the Frame Library**

Then click convert - it's that simple!
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need to manually trace or edit frames?">
No, Image to Frames is fully automatic. Just upload your image and click convert - no manual tracing or editing needed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What image formats are supported?">
Image to Frames supports PNG, JPG, and SVG formats. Works with photos, illustrations, and vector graphics.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I use frames from the Frame Library?">
1. Browse and search frames on the website
2. Download the SVG frame file
3. **Important**: Import the downloaded file into the Image to Frames app in Canva (don't just upload it as a regular file)
4. Your frame is ready to use
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why do I need to import frames into the app instead of just uploading them?">
Frames downloaded from the Frame Library must be imported into the Image to Frames app in Canva to work correctly. Simply uploading the SVG file won't work - it needs to be imported through the app.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

Try refreshing your Canva app or logging out and back in. If the issue persists, contact customer support for assistance.

Make sure you're using a Pro account. Free users cannot use the conversion feature. Also check that your image is in a supported format (PNG, JPG, or SVG).
