Learn how to use Image to Frames in your Canva designs. This guide covers importing frames, adding images, and creating professional designs.

## Overview

Image to Frames is a Canva app that works directly within your Canva designs. Once you've created or imported a frame, you can use it immediately in your projects.

## Using converted frames

After converting an image to a frame:

<Steps>
<Step title="Frame appears automatically">
Your converted frame appears in your Canva design immediately after conversion.

<Step title="Add images to frame">
Drag any image from your uploads or Canva's media library into the frame. The image will be automatically cropped to fit the frame's shape.
</Step>

<Step title="Adjust image position">
Click on the framed image to adjust how the image is positioned within the frame. Drag the image to reposition it.
</Step>

<Step title="Resize and style">

</Step>
</Steps>

## Importing frames from Frame Library

<Warning>
**Important**: When you download frames from the Frame Library, you must import them into the Image to Frames app in Canva. Simply downloading the SVG file won't work - the frame needs to be imported into the app to display correctly.

<Step title="Download frame">
Download a frame from the [Frame Library](https://qrdynamic.xyz/imagetoframe-in-canva) and save it to your device.
</Step>

<Step title="Open Image to Frames in Canva">
Open the Image to Frames app from your Apps panel in Canva.
</Step>

<Step title="Import frame">
Click "Import" or "Upload" and select the downloaded SVG frame file.
</Step>

<Step title="Frame is ready">
Your imported frame is now available in your Canva design and ready to use.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Frame doesn't appear after import">
Make sure you imported the frame into the Image to Frames app in Canva, not just uploaded it as a regular file. The frame must be imported through the app.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Image doesn't fit the frame">
The image might be too small. Try:
- Using a larger, higher-resolution image
- Resizing the frame to match your image size
- Adjusting the image position within the frame
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can't resize frame">
You can resize frames in Canva by dragging the corner handles. Hold Shift to maintain proportions. For exact sizes, use Canva's resize tool.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Frame looks pixelated">
Make sure you're using high-resolution images. If you imported a frame, ensure it was imported correctly through the Image to Frames app.
